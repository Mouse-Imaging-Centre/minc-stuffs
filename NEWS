New in Version 0.1.14
=====================
* completely remove the multiprocessing machinery from pmincaverage since this caused extra processes
  to be spawned even when running single-threaded, causing large memory usage to be attributed to
  running pmincaverage instances.  If necessary, this machinery could be reinstated
  behind some conditional logic.
* small upgrades to voxel_vote: better help messages and argument parsing, 
  ability to vote on a single file, small code improvements, --(no-)clobber respected
* sge_batch has been removed; use pipetone/qbatch instead
* atlas_to_atlas.pl has been added, though use of Pydpiper's MAGeT.py is recommended in general
* tagtoxfm and some supporting code have been added to allow their use in environments without
  a build of the visual tools from minc-toolkit

New in Version 0.1.13
=====================
* code changes to ensure python3 compatibility

New in Version 0.1.12
=====================
* added the option -flip-images to ray_trace_crosshair in case you are working with a version of 
  MINC that flips images when using ray_trace
* fixed bug in minc_label_ops; the binarize option now works
* rotational_minctracc uses subprocess instead of system to ensure you get a non-zero return when
  the program fails. Also added the --simplex option. By default the simplex value that was used
  was only appropriate for human brains. For mouse brains you can set this to 1 (mm) for instance.

New in Version 0.1.11
=====================
* turned off multiprocessing in pmincaverage, because it sometimes crashes on compressed MINC files

New in Version 0.1.10
=====================
* more updates to smooth_vector: exists with a non-zero return (1) if the output file can not be created

New in Version 0.1.9
====================
* smooth_vector: provide useful output when the input does not exist, or is broken
* minc_displacement: if the output file can not be written to disk, exit with 1 (instead of 0...)

New in Version 0.1.8
====================
* clobber option in pmincaverage is activated

New in Version 0.1.7
====================
* added vtk_meshconvert.py a program that can be used to convert between BIC obj, stl and vtk meshes
* added bayes_intensity_update a program that updates an image based on prior knowledge coming from a population (and its stdev)

New in Version 0.1.6
====================
* fixes egg-info file issues. The minc-stuffs version information will be produced correctly now

New in Version 0.1.5
====================
* fixes cython/numpy compilation issues with anaconda-2.1.0

New in Version 0.1.4
====================
* added rotational_minctracc.py 

New in Version 0.1.3
====================
* compute_values_across_segmentation, volumes_from_labels_only, and voxel_vote now accepts label files with up to 65536 labels (instead of 256)
* voxel_vote now properly writes out label files (integer values)

New in Version 0.1.2
====================
* minc-stuffs can now be compiled against the minc-toolkit
